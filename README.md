1. Planned the optimal route with minimal time or cost to destination according to current traffic and weather by applying admissible heuristics and implementing A* Search. 
2. Located optimal spots of police patrol to minimize emergency response time by implementing Depth-First Search and backtrack algorithm. 
3. Reduced search runtime from over 5 minutes to under 30 seconds by using alpha-beta pruning combined with greedy algorithm. 
4. Determined optimal policy for Markov decision process (MDP) by using value iteration algorithm and predicted accordingly optimal utility.
