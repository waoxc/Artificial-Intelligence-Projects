• Planned optimal route with minimal time or cost to destination according to current traffic and weather by applying admissible heuristics and implementing A* Search.

• Located optimal spots of police patrol to minimize emergency response time by implementing Depth-First Search and backtrack algorithm.

• Reduced search runtime from over 5 minutes to under 30 seconds by using a-b pruning combined with greedy algorithm.

• Determined optimal policy for Markov decision process (MDP) by using value iteration algorithm and predicted accordingly optimal utility.
